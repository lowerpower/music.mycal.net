🐔 Petaluma Chicken Scratch: A Local Legend 🌱❤️

It started out with a cookie clone,
Guava wind and garden stone.
Brother-in-law with a backyard plan,
Dirt on our hands, and a sunburn tan.
Seeds took root and the flavors bloomed,
Guava Cookie in a smokey room.
Next year came with a chili kick,
Clearlake fire made the cross stick.

Scratch that ground, Petaluma pride,
Sativa dreams on a compost ride.
Starts in hand, we pass it back,
Born from soil and a chicken shack.
Oh, Petaluma Chicken Scratch —
The legend grows, you can’t match that!
The legend grows, you can’t match that!

Burning Man crew said, “Turn it up!”
Snicker Doodle made the flowers erupt.
We fed the beds with coop-born gold,
The buds got loud, the highs got bold.
Four pounds deep from just six green,
Still the folks lined up, sight unseen.
Not for sale, this gift we grow,
Each new start makes the story glow.

Scratch that ground, Petaluma pride,
Sativa dreams on a compost ride.
Starts in hand, we pass it back,
Born from soil and a chicken shack.
Oh, Petaluma Chicken Scratch —
The legend grows, you can’t match that!

If you get a male, don’t throw it away,
Pair it right, let the garden play.
Save the seeds, keep the flame,
Write your chapter in the strain’s name.

Scratch that ground, make your mark,
Petaluma nights and backyard spark.
Start to seed, pass it on,
In our town, this legend’s strong.
The roots run deep, and the vibe’s intact!
The roots run deep, and the vibe’s intact!

Burning Man crew said, “Turn it up!”
Snicker Doodle made the flowers erupt.
We fed the beds with coop-born gold,
The buds got loud, the highs got bold.
Four pounds deep from just six green,
Still the folks lined up, sight unseen.
Not for sale, this gift we grow,
Each new start makes the story glow.

If you get a male, don’t throw it away,
Pair it right, let the garden play.
Save the seeds, keep the flame,
Write your chapter in the strain’s name.
