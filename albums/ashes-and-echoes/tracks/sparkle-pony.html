      <pre>
Whop-whop-whop, I’m here to slay...

Chopper drops me, hear the hum, 
Playa’s red carpet, here I come. 
Dressed in shine, no dust on me, 
Selfie throne’s my destiny. 
Billionaires can’t look away, 
Art cars frame my big display. 
Snap that shot, I’m here to slay, 
Sparkle Pony’s born today!

I’m the Sparkle Pony, watch me glow, 
Playa’s my runway, steal the show. 
Flash my grin for Insta’s crown, 
Burning Man’s my playground now!

(Ooh-oh-oh) Sparkle Pony, queen supreme, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Glitter reigns, my perfect dream, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Strut and shine, then I’m gone, 
Sparkle Pony, rule the dawn!

Neon glow’s my spotlight beam, 
Billionaires chase my scene. 
“Move aside—fuck your burn!” I yell, 
Playa’s mine, can’t you tell? 
Filters pop, my vibe’s the best, 
Dust’s for losers, I’m the quest. 
Twenty-four, then jet off high, 
Sparkle Pony owns the sky!

I’m the Sparkle Pony, watch me glow, 
Playa’s my runway, steal the show. 
Flash that grin for selfie clout, 
Burning Man’s my spotlight shout!

Crowd’s in awe, I’ve set the trend, 
Glitter’s gold, my reign won’t end. 
Playa bows beneath my feet, 
Sparkle Pony can’t be beat! 
Jet revs up, I’m out in style, 
Burning Man’s my victory mile!

I’m the Sparkle Pony, watch me glow, 
Playa my runway, steal the show. 
Flash that grin for likes galore, 
Burning Man’s my glitter war!

(Ooh-oh-oh) Sparkle Pony, queen supreme, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Glitter reigns, my perfect dream, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Strut and jet, I’m outta sight, 
Sparkle Pony, burn so bright!

(Ooh-oh-oh) Sparkle Pony, queen supreme, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Glitter reigns, my perfect dream, 
(Ooh-oh-oh) Strut and jet, I’m outta sight, 
Sparkle Pony, burn so bright!
