        <p>A tongue-in-cheek ode to every glittered friend who shows up with vibes and leaves with your crescent wrench. Bouncy beats, talkbox hooks, and a lot of heart.</p>

      <div class="lyrics">
You rolled in with rhinestone goggles
Borrowed my bike, disappeared to the Man
Came back at dawn with a thousand stories
And somehow still no water in your can

Chorus:
Sparkle pony, stealing tools and stealing hearts
Covered in glitter and playa dust art
Sparkle pony, we laugh because it’s true
You keep the vibe alive, we keep looking out for you

Verse 2:
You said “I’ll help with camp teardown”
Then followed a dragonfly drone
We love you even when we’re sweeping
Silver stars you left on every cone

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Radical inclusion means we keep you fed
Teach you MOOP and gift a spare bed
By the end of the burn you’re patching tents
Learning the ropes with a joy that never ends

Final chorus:
Sparkle pony, stealing tools and stealing hearts
Covered in glitter and playa dust art
Sparkle pony, we laugh because it’s true
You keep the vibe alive, we keep looking out for you
