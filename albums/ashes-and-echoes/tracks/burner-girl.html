      <h2>About this track</h2>
      <p>
        “Burner Girl” is a desert crush anthem — a neon-lit love song about finding your orbit around
        a wild, glowing soul on the Playa. It lives where lasers, basslines, and dust storms collide:
        art cars rolling by, heartbeat to heartbeat, two burners spinning through the night like they
        were meant to meet there all along.

      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
rolling through the gate after 12 hours of traffic
finally setup camp, grab my trusty steed and head out
to deep Playa, as the day empties out I see...

BURNER GIRL!

(Ayy! Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh!)

Out in the desert, the sun’s dipping low,
Dust swirls around, but she steals the glow.
Draped in the wild, she’s untamed and free,
A spark in the haze, she’s beckoning me.
Pulses ignite with the night’s desert call,
Lost on the Playa, I’m drawn where she’s from.
She dances in shadows, a neon-lit gleam,
A soul of the burn, my radical dream.

The baseline drops, and the night ignites,
She’s glowing wild under laser lights.
I’m caught in her orbit, can’t break away,
Burner Girl’s got me, I’m here to stay.

Burner Girl, light me up, set me free,
Dancing through the dust, you’re my revelry.
Burner Girl, take my hand, lead the way,
In this desert dream, forever we’ll play.
(Ooh-oh-oh) Burner Girl, you’re the flame,
(Ooh-oh-oh) Burning bright, no shame,
(Ooh-oh-oh) Spin me round, yell my name,
Burner Girl, Burner Girl, ignite the FLAME!

She’s got a smile like the sunrise glow,
A rebel with wings where the wild winds blow.
Art cars are rolling, the beat’s in my chest,
She pulls me closer, I’m lost in her quest.
Tents in the madness, stars burn above,
Her voice in the chaos, it’s all she said:
“Live for the moment, let’s ride the flame,”
Burner Girl’s spark won’t be Contained.

The baseline drops, and the night ignites,
She’s glowing wild under laser lights.
I’m caught in her orbit, can’t break away,
Burner Girl’s got me, I’m here to stay.

Burner Girl, spark the night, set me free,
Dust and fire, you’re my fantasy
Burner Girl, take my hand, lead me there,
In this desert dream, we’re lost in the air.
(Ooh-oh-oh) Burner Girl, you ignite,
(Ooh-oh-oh) Burning bright, no shame,
(Ooh-oh-oh) Spin me round, yell my name,
Burner Girl, Burner Girl, light the FLAME!

The fire’s alive, the crowd’s in a trance,
She pulls me in with a single glance.
Heartbeat to heartbeat, we’re synced to the sound,
In this dusty wonderland, love’s what we found.
Oh, the night’s eternal, the stars never fade,
Burner Girl, with you, I’m never afraid!
(Ayy! Whoa-oh!)

Out in the desert, where the wild hearts run,
Burner Girl, you’re my rising sun.
Heartbeat to heartbeat, we’re synced to the sound,
In this dusty wonderland, love’s what we found.
(ayoow!)

BURNER GIRL, take my hand (Ayy!)

BURNER GIRL, lead the way (Whoa-oh!)

BURNER GIRL, set me free, (Ayy! )

マイカル.... Call me home

(Whoa)
マイカル.... Call me home
