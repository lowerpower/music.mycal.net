burn it all down

Lost in the desert, Lost My mind,
Steel and fire covering my crime

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
dowwn
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all doooowwn

lost in the desert, i see a fire in the distance,
I know I was meant to burn

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
