      <p>
        “I was Meant to Burn” circles the image of the Man and the Temple as both sacrifice and release — a loop of destruction,
        rebuilding, and the quiet realization that some part of you was always destined for the flame.

Lost in the desert, Lost My mind,
Steel and fire covering my crime

Reared in Steel burn it hot burn it down burn it now
Reared in Steel burn it hot I need to burn it now

raised in fire and steel, raised to burn it all
raised in fire and steel, raised to build it all
raised in fire and steel, raised to burn it all down
burn it all down
burn it all down

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down

fire in the desert, steel in my heart
fire in the desert, steel in my heart
fire and steel, fire and steel everywhere

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down

lost in the desert, i see a fire in the distance,
I know I was meant to burn

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn it all down

burn it all down

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down

lost in the desert, i see a fire in the distance,
I know I was meant to burn

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down

Lost in the desert, Lost My mind,
Steel and fire covering my crime

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
dowwn
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all doooowwn

lost in the desert, i see a fire in the distance,
I know I was meant to burn

burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
burn the man
burn the temple
burn it all down
