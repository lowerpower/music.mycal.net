“Do you have any glitter-free hugs?”
“Follow the light-up otter, we’re two blocks past the taco bus!”
“I fixed your derailleur with a spoon.”
“Hydrate or die-drate” written on a balloon.

Chorus:
Overheard at Burning Man, caught between the beats
Snippets in the dust that make the city feel complete
Overheard at Burning Man, laughter on repeat
Every little phrase becomes a song beneath our feet

Verse 2:
“Temple’s that way, follow the quiet.”
“Is that a satellite or just playa diet?”
“My gift is shade, my gift is tea.”
“Does anybody know where my campmates might be?”

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Voices echo through the plywood halls
Words drift upward when the neon falls
What we say becomes the memory thread
We take the quotes home, hang them over our beds

Last chorus:
Overheard at Burning Man, caught between the beats
Snippets in the dust that make the city feel complete
Overheard at Burning Man, laughter on repeat
Every little phrase becomes a song beneath our feet
