We weld the frame in moonlit sparks
Map stars with tape on plywood arcs
We sleep in shifts, the desert hums
A thousand miles of rebar drums

Chorus:
Ashes and echoes, the stories we keep
Written in sawdust and inked in the deep
Burning and building, we learn how to let go
Ashes and echoes, then on with the show

Sunrise paint on alkali
We raise the spires against the sky
Someone hands coffee, someone sings
The playa dust on everything

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Let the Temple breathe, let the fire speak
Let the art cars prowl while the lasers streak
When the match is struck and the crowd leans near
We remember the names of those not here

Last chorus:
Ashes and echoes, the stories we keep
Written in sawdust and inked in the deep
Burning and building, we learn how to let go
Ashes and echoes, then on with the show
