      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
This one's forged in Petaluma — born to burn.  
Live from 9 &amp; A — WEIRD STEEL!  

Weird Steel forged at 9 &amp; A  
Right on the edge where the fire gods play  
Step through the portal where the weird ones stay  
We build with flame — we don’t play halfway  

Couch in the sky, grilled cheese in hand  
Cookies at noon, propane unplanned  
Come find us tomorrow — or better, today  
Weird Steel’s got the bar and a burner buffet (whoooa!)

We are Reared in Steel — Petaluma born (yeah!)  
Rhino Redemption with a fire-spitting horn (let it rise!)  
(Target’s open!) (Flower Tower glows!)  
We light the night where the fire wind blows (whoooa!)  

Kevin sparks the sky,  
Dave’s the fix-it guy  
Andre’s got the plan and the best tan alive (yeah!)  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — let it burn, let it rise  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — see the dust in our eyes (whoooa!)

We gave you Medusa, and the Fire Kathedral’s flare  
Love Pod Forest, where sparks fill the air  
Ladybug rides with a spark and a smile  
Harper's GUMA glows, wrapped in style (fire!)  

Slushies and Reiki, cookies on cue  
Weddings, sky rides, and a century too  
Fifty feet high — a couch to the stars  
We don’t just party — we build art cars 

Strike team’s ready, MOOPin’ in stride  
Rhino’s groovin’ while the flames fly wide (boom!)  
Advice on bread, truth on toast (mmm-hmm)  
We gift it loud — that’s what we do most (yeah!)

We are Reared in Steel — forged in love (yeah!)  
From the Petaluma hills to the stars above  
Brass Ring spins, and our stories ignite  
Weird Steel rides through the magic night  

Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — let it burn, let it rise  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — we got stars in our eyes (whoooa!)
