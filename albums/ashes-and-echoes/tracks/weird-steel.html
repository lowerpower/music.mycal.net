      <h2>About this track</h2>
      <p>
        “Weird Steel” is the Reared in Steel anthem — forged in Petaluma, broadcast from 9 &amp; A.
        It’s a shout-out to Rhino Redemption, Medusa, the Fire Kathedral, GUMA, couches in the sky,
        grilled cheese, slushies, MOOP strike teams, and the dusty crew that keeps building year
        after year. Camp lore turned into a sing-along.

      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
This one's forged in Petaluma — born to burn.  
Live from 9 &amp; A — WEIRD STEEL!  

Weird Steel forged at 9 &amp; A  
Right on the edge where the fire gods play  
Step through the portal where the weird ones stay  
We build with flame — we don’t play halfway  

Couch in the sky, grilled cheese in hand  
Cookies at noon, propane unplanned  
Come find us tomorrow — or better, today  
Weird Steel’s got the bar and a burner buffet (whoooa!)

We are Reared in Steel — Petaluma born (yeah!)  
Rhino Redemption with a fire-spitting horn (let it rise!)  
(Target’s open!) (Flower Tower glows!)  
We light the night where the fire wind blows (whoooa!)  

Kevin sparks the sky,  
Dave’s the fix-it guy  
Andre’s got the plan and the best tan alive (yeah!)  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — let it burn, let it rise  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — see the dust in our eyes (whoooa!)

We gave you Medusa, and the Fire Kathedral’s flare  
Love Pod Forest, where sparks fill the air  
Ladybug rides with a spark and a smile  
Harper's GUMA glows, wrapped in style (fire!)  

Slushies and Reiki, cookies on cue  
Weddings, sky rides, and a century too  
Fifty feet high — a couch to the stars  
We don’t just party — we build art cars 

Strike team’s ready, MOOPin’ in stride  
Rhino’s groovin’ while the flames fly wide (boom!)  
Advice on bread, truth on toast (mmm-hmm)  
We gift it loud — that’s what we do most (yeah!)

We are Reared in Steel — forged in love (yeah!)  
From the Petaluma hills to the stars above  
Brass Ring spins, and our stories ignite  
Weird Steel rides through the magic night  

Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — let it burn, let it rise  
Weird Steel! (Weird Steel!) — we got stars in our eyes (whoooa!)
