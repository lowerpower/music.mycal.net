(Matter Out Of Place!)\nWhat's a Darkwad? (Unlit in your face!)\nWho's a Wook? (Begs and bakes and mooches)\nWhat's a Solifuge? (Fast with too many leggy scooches)\nWhat's Piss Clear? (Hydrate 'til you pee!)\nWhat's TTITD? (That Thing in the D!)\nWho's the Man? (Not the cops, the one we burn!)\nWhat's a Theme Camp? (Where weirdos take their turn!)\n\nBRC's got Avenues, from 2 to 10\nStreets from A to L — but no straight lines, friend\nArctica slings ice at 3, 6, and 9\nDPW builds it all, then drinks it all in time\nRangers roam gently, BMIR calls storms\nThe DMZ pounds bass while the Man transforms\nThe Fallopian Tubes lead us in like a womb\nBut Exodus gonna trap you, bring snacks, resume\n\nSpeak Burner to me — throw dust like slang\nRadical Inclusion in a no-pants gang\nSpeak Burner to me — ten principles high\nWith a pants cannon ready and glitter in your eye\nSay \"Flame Effect,\" say \"Foe-moe,\" say \"Free\"\nWelcome Home, mycal — now speak Burner to me \n(yeah! yaaaah!)\n\nBORG! BLM! MOOP it up, then do it again\nEL Wire glow, Esplanade show\nMutant Vehicle rides in a giant rhino whoa\nRV Fortress? That's a no\nSCUM of the Earth? Plug-and-Play bro\nCollexodus, Rebar, P&P\nWhite-Out storm? You can't see me!\nReality Bends, Sparkle Lens\nMuggles don't get it — but this never ends\n\n\nSo if someone asks you where you've been...\nJust whisper, \"The Playa.\"\nAnd if they don't get it...\nSpeak burner to them.",

      <p>
        “Speak Burner to Me” is the Black Rock City phrasebook turned into a track — a playful,
        high-density glossary of Burner slang, acronyms, and inside jokes. It’s half language lesson,
        half knowing wink: if you can sing along, you’re probably already Home.

Playya… yeah
No, not playya — it’s Playa (say it right)
You ready?
Let’s go…

Welcome to Home, it’s That Thing in the Desert
You’re a Burr-gin no more once you roll in the dust
Grab your ticket, greet the Greeter, ring the bell, shed your name
Get a Playa one instead — now you’re in the game
We don’t do the ‘Default World’ — no commerce, no shame
Just dust, art, fire, and a Temple in flames
From 10 to 2, from thunder to flashy
This ain’t no festival, it’s full-on batshit classy

Speak Burner to me — define your tribe
Say “MOOP” not “trash,” let the sparkle slide
Speak Burner to me — in dust we trust
From Arctica ice to the Temple dust
Say “radical,” say “now,” say “Free”
If you know, you know — speak Burner to me
(yeah… whoooa…)

It’s Civic with Consent, and Decom with feels
It’s Line Walks, Leave No Trace, bacon meals on wheels
It’s Mutant Vehicles cruisin’ loud in the night
From Robo Heart drops to a dust bike flight
Lamplighters glowin’, the Fluffers bring booze
Java Cow says “cream or sugar?” — you choose
Shirtcockers struttin’, Sparkle Ponies pout
If your camp’s got a fence, then your vibe’s sold out

What’s MOOP? (Matter Out Of Place!)
What’s a Darkwad? (Unlit in your face!)
Who’s a Wook? (Begs and bakes and mooches)
What’s a Solifuge? (Fast with too many leggy scooches)
What’s Piss Clear? (Hydrate ‘til you pee!)
What’s TTITD? (That Thing in the D!)
Who’s the Man? (Not the cops, the one we burn!)
What’s a Theme Camp? (Where weirdos take their turn!)

BRC’s got Avenues, from 2 to 10
Streets from A to L — but no straight lines, friend
Arctica slings ice at 3, 6, and 9
DPW builds it all, then drinks it all in time
Rangers roam gently, BMIR calls storms
The DMZ pounds bass while the Man transforms
The Fallopian Tubes lead us in like a womb
But Exodus gonna trap you, bring snacks, resume

Speak Burner to me — throw dust like slang
Radical Inclusion in a no-pants gang
Speak Burner to me — ten principles high
With a pants cannon ready and glitter in your eye
Say “Flame Effect,” say “Foe-moe,” say “Free”
Welcome Home, mycal — now speak Burner to me 
(yeah! yaaaah!)

BORG! BLM! MOOP it up, then do it again
EL Wire glow, Esplanade show
Mutant Vehicle rides in a giant rhino whoa
RV Fortress? That’s a no
SCUM of the Earth? Plug-and-Play bro
Collexodus, Rebar, P&amp;P
White-Out storm? You can't see me!
Reality Bends, Sparkle Lens
Muggles don’t get it — but this never ends


So if someone asks you where you’ve been...
Just whisper, “The Playa.”
And if they don’t get it...
Speak burner to them.
