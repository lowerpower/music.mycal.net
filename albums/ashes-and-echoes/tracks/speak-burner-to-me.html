Call me on the radio, channel three at half past two
Tell me where the art car’s parked, I’ll bring playa gifts to you
Ask me if I packed the MOOP stick, ask me if I’ve seen the Man
Speak burner to me, darling, only we will understand

Chorus:
Speak burner to me, say “meet me at the trash fence”
Whisper “temple time at midnight,” make the dust feel heaven-sent
Speak burner to me, in the glow of LED
I’ll answer with a thumbs-up blinky heart for you and me

Verse 2:
You say “deep playa rendezvous, look for sequined fox tail”
I reply “copy, dust storm rising, grab your scarf, we will prevail.”
You laugh “my bike chain’s off again,” I show up with a wrench
Our language tastes like vinegar when morning fog is dense

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Leave your jargon at the gate? No, we lean into the slang
Our secret code is friendship, every phrase a spark that sang
When the week is over and the open sky is clear
We’ll text those burner phrases to keep the desert near

Final chorus:
Speak burner to me, say “meet me at the trash fence”
Whisper “temple time at midnight,” make the dust feel heaven-sent
Speak burner to me, in the glow of LED
I’ll answer with a thumbs-up blinky heart for you and me
