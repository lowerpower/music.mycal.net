      <h2>About this track</h2>
      <p>
        “The Buck Bandersnatch Song (Playa Dreams)” drifts through runes, tarot pulls, JuPlaya nights
        and temple cloth embers. It’s a whispered confession about surrender and joy, etched in Wunjo,
        dust, and the sense that the Playa might be ending something — or starting something entirely
        new.

      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
(mmm), (yeah),  JOY!

Woke up with a ember on the temple cloth
Not an i, it was j  and Joy spoke soft
WUNJO carved in the dust with my hand
ᚹ in the flame, I try to understand

I got no paper, no plan, no pay
But I got this dust, and I got this way
The Playa knows — and the Playa speaks
She draws back the curtain, she kisses my cheek
(ply-uhhh...)(joy!) (yeah...) (joy!)

JuPlaya, strong reception, man
Dick-cunt glistening, gods in the sand
Runes fell like thunder, called me “slave”
But I listened deep and I tried to be brave

The tarot's a mirror, the rune is the stone
I fell for a woman who made me go home
She called herself Heartsong, and I got clean
She found her Leo, and I found my dream

“Commeth the hour, commeth the man…”
I burned the cash, I broke the plan
I saw the signs, and I let them in
I met the storm, I met my kin

The Playa knows — and the Playa gives
Everything you are, and everything that lives
We build, we break, we burn, we bend
But fuck it, my friend, this might be the end
or the start... (mmm...) (joy!)

INGWAZ on its side, Tiwaz on my chest
Thurisaz on my belly, I gave it my best
Frozen year cycle, portal at the table
Fire shouts random, if you’re willing and able

Snakes and moonlight, cigarettes and screams
Mario Kart countdown in ritual dreams
Had to have a sit, let the stone speak clear
It said: “Joy lives in surrender, my dear”

So maybe I’m dying, or maybe I’m free
Maybe I’m nothing — maybe I’m me
I’ll be in sunlight, or I’ll be in shade
But I’ll be on Playa…where legends are made

501 more to go, the dust don’t lie
Get your shit together — look to the sky
This may be it, or the start of more
But the temple’s whispering…like it did before…

WUNJO...
find your joy again..
Let go...
