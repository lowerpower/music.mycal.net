      <p>
        “We Did Start the Fire (Burning Man History Jam)” is a rhythmic ritual, a timeline-in-flames,
        and a campfire chant for the dust-born. Tracing Burning Man’s evolution from a rope on Baker
        Beach to towering temples and art cars in the void, the song weaves names, myths, and moments
        into a lyrical memory loop. It’s not just history — it’s oral tradition, glitch-folk gospel,
        and a wink to the firestarter in all of us.

"Before the apps… before the wristbands…
before the permits and the sparkle Ponies…
there was Baker Beach… a bonfire… a rope…
and an idea passed between friends.”
(beat)
“That idea found dust… and space…
and the Playa gave it room to grow.”

Baker Beach, Zone Trip Four Cacophony kicks the door,
Harvey, James and TAZ, black suits, jazz and desert daze.
Danger Ranger, Peter Pan, code 007 man,
Marian's Seventy-Eight Olds, Larry’s dream, the story unfolds. , (humming “mmm-hmm”)
Christmas Camp, Turbo Ted, Stagger Sisters, raver heads,
Goa Gil, John Law’s Doghead show,
3-Day Stubble, let it go!
Pull the rope, raise the Man,
Nothing was yet pre-planned,
Trash fence, lamps lit, Center Camp misfits

We did start the fire!
Lit it on the Playa, and it’s getting higher!
We did start the fire!
Rangers on patrol now, never gonna tire.

Papa Satan, Hellco crew, Techno Ghetto breaks right through,
Regulations rolling in, John Law’s departure begins.
Hualapai and Fly Ranch, LNT in every branch,
Rod Garrett draws the plan, theme camps sprawl across the land.
Pier to Pier, Temple Flux, Mantfarm, mutant art trucks,
Bliss Dance, Rites of Passage, Trojan Horse, DPW’s wreckage.
TV Free and Big Rig’s roar,
Jiffy Lube and camel corps,
Space Whale, Light House, drones, drones, drones!
Aaron’s hat and shattered bones.
(Woooohhh)

We did start the fire!
On the open Playa, glowing in the wire.
We did start the fire!
Even when it's gone, the myth keeps burning higher.

Rangers in the dust at dawn,
Code Double Oh then he’s gone.
Exploding Man in ‘98,
Eviction seals a dusty fate.
Mowers parked out in the void,
Absurdity we all enjoyed.
Sergey camps, BLM heat, DPW won’t face defeat,
Art cars, stilt stars, Aaron’s clock and hexed guitars.
White Ocean, Catacombs,
Bank of Un-America loans,
Church Trap's got no grace,
Temple’s fire lights your face.
Robots walk, Nixon’s law,
Hexatron draws the awe.
Tenner bikes, burner rites,
Welcome home on desert nights.
No minivan, no glam parade,
Just boot prints where the dream was made. (aaaaya)
We did start the fire!
Burned it all to ashes, made a spire higher.
We did start the fire!
Now we’re dust and legends, riding out the wire.
“They say we leave no trace.
But look closer…
There’s footprints under the dust.
Signals in the static.
And echoes from a campfire…
that burned before the map had names
“Mycal, You just had to be there.”

We did start the fire!
On the open Playa, glowing in the wire.
We did start the fire!
Even when it's gone, the myth keeps burning higher.

Rangers in the dust at dawn,
Code 007 — then he’s gone.
Exploding Man in ‘98,
Eviction seals a dusty fate.
