      <p>
        “Ten Principles, One Heart” is the Playa pledge turned into a chorus. It walks through the dust
        with a backpack of dreams and turns the principles into something you can shout with your camp:
        radical inclusion, gifting, immediacy, communal effort, and a reminder that when the burn is
        over, the real temple is the way we carry each other home.

      <pre class="lyrics-block">
Rollin’ through dust with a backpack of dreams
Playa wind howlin’ through busted-up seams
Met a stranger who gave me cold tea and a smile
Said “Welcome home, stay weird for a while”
LED bikes like a galaxy spun
The party don’t end with the rising sun
Every step in the sand leaves a spark in your soul
Every camp’s burning a piece of the whole

Ten principles, one heart 
We glow like sparks in the dark 
We gift, we build, we play our part 
Radical love, that's our art 
From dust to flame, we rise and start 
Ten principles, one heart 
(yaaaah!)

Radical welcome wherever you land 
Self-expression kicks up the sand
 
No brands, no deals — just soul and skin 
A gift in your hand, no price, just grin
Dust in your hair, a beat in your soul 
Every sunrise makes you feel whole 
Art takes flight in a desert dream 
Living the moment, a vibrant stream
No trace left but the stories we tell
Immediacy's real, a truth you can tell
Communal effort, leave ego behind
Consent and respect — we stay radically kind

Leave your titles, your status, your plan 
Become the dust, the art, the clan 
On the edge of the void, we dance and ignite 
Burn the fears, let your joy take flight
Strip off the masks, let the real you shine 
In the dust we’re all one — no yours, no mine 
(yeahhh!) 
Sing it now—

Ten principles, one heart (say it loud!) 
Glowin’ wild in the dark (shout it proud!) 
We build, we dance, we share our spark 
Radical dreams leave a mark 
From dust to light, we play our part 
Ten principles, one heart 
(whoooa!) 
Ten principles, one heart 
(ohhh yeah!) 
Ten principles, one heart
Ten principles! (One heart!)

Back to the dust, where the heart stays free 
Ten principles live in you and me.
