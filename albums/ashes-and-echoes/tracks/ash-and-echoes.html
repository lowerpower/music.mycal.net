        “Ash and Echoes (The Temple Song)” is the quiet center of the album — a hymn for the Temple,
        where feathers, photos, names and dust all meet the fire. It follows the walk in, the burn,
        and the strange lightness that comes after we let go of what we could never quite say out loud.

      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <pre>
(mmm-hmm...)

Dust on my boots, sun on my face
Carrying names through this sacred space
A thousand hearts stitched into wood
Burning what words never could

Wind sings low where silence stays
I trace the loss in lines and names
Every tear a story told
In the cracks of the Temple’s soul
(yeah…)

Some came to grieve, some came to pray
Some just needed to give it away
(whoah...)

Ash and echoes in the sky
Let it rise, let it fly
What we couldn’t carry home
We leave in flame and leave alone
No judgment here, no need to speak
The Temple knows what we all seek

Ash and echoes — let 'em rise
And settle back into the Playa’s sigh
(ohhh… mmm-hmm)

Feathers, photos, notes and dust
Built with grief, and built with trust
She stands for those we’ve had to lose
And everything we didn’t choose

We walk in quiet, line by line
Each soul a story left behind
A hush beneath the stars so wide
As if the whole world paused to cry
(whoah… yeah…)

Ash and echoes in the sky
Let it rise, let it fly
What we couldn’t carry home
We leave in flame and leave alone

Ash and echoes — let 'em rise
And settle back into the Playa's sigh
Ash and echoes — burn and fly
Become the dust beneath the sky
(mmm-hmm…)

And when the fire takes her form
We are lighter than before
She falls in grace, and we are new
Ashes carried into truth

Now she lives beneath our feet
In the dust where silence speaks
